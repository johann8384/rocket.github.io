> _Rocket is a technique for building real-time functionality on top of REST web services that leverages web standards like [Server-Sent Events][SSE] and [JSON Patch][RFC6902]._ Most importantly, it fits comfortably with how you're already building applications.

# A Tale of Two Paradigms

>> Just as light can act as both a _particle_ and a _wave_ so information can be thought as both a _document_ and a _stream_.

Cloud application developers are comfortable interacting with data like documents, according to REST conventions, but messages could also be subscribed to, as a stream, such that new messages pushed to the client in real-time.

Each approach has its particular strengths and weaknesses:

- **Documents** are _stateless_, _long-lived_ and _cacheable_, but must be polled for changes
- **Streams** are _stateful_, _ad-hoc_, and _real-time_, but has limited semantics for managing information

It's clear that real-time will be increasingly important as cloud applications become more connected and ubiquitous, but there will still be a need for the current request-response architecture.

## Rocket is a proposal for how to bridge this gap.

According to REST conventions, when a client makes an HTTP `GET` request to a resource endpoint, a list of records is returned. With Rocket, a client can additionally subscribe to changes for that resource by requesting an event stream at that endpoint.

<table id="document-versus-stream">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Document</th>
      <th>Stream</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Request</td>
      <td>
<pre><code>GET /resources
Accept: application/json
</code></pre></td>
      <td>
<pre><code>GET /resources
Accept: text/event-stream
</code></pre></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Response</td>
      <td>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{"resources": [...]}
</code></pre></td>
      <td>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/event-stream

event: patch
data: [{"op": "add", "path": "/resources/123", "value": {...}}]
</code></pre></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Anytime a record is _created_, _updated_, or _destroyed_, an event is sent in real-time over the event stream, encoding the changes as a JSON Patch document.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Create</th>
      <th>Update</th>
      <th>Destroy</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <tt>
<pre>{
  "op": "add",
  "path": "/resources/123",
  "value": {...}
}</pre>
        </tt>
      </td>
      <td>
        <tt>
<pre>{
  "op": "update",
  "path": "/resources/123",
  "value": {...}
}</pre>
        </tt>
      </td>
      <td>
        <tt>
<pre>{
  "op": "remove",
  "path": "/resources/123"
}</pre></tt>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

# Building on a Solid Foundation

>> Building robust, scalable software is difficult, but not nearly as tricky as getting developers to agree on things. _Standards, Conventions, and Specifications allow us to stop bike-shedding, and get back to solving real problems._

## REST

[**Re**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer][REST], or <acronym>REST</acronym>, is a convention for structuring web application interfaces.

Resources are accessed and manipulated using the existing vocabulary and semantics of HTTP:

- `GET /messages` **reads** a list of messages
- `POST /messages` **creates** a new message
- `GET /messages/123` **reads** a message
- `PUT /messages/123` **updates** a message
- `DELETE /messages/123` **destroys** a message

## Server-Sent Events

[Server-Sent Events][SSE] are used to push events to clients over a persistent HTTP connection. An event source stream is designated by the `text/event-stream` MIME type.

Event messages are composed of newline-delimited fields, each of which contains the field name, followed by a colon, followed by the associated value. The following fields are defined in the specification:

- `event`: The event's type.
- `id`: The event ID.
- `data`: The data field for the message. Multiple lines that begin with "data:" will have their lines concatenated with a newline.
- `retry`: The reconnection time to use when attempting to send the event. This must be an integer, specifying the reconnection time in milliseconds. If a non-integer value is specified, the field is ignored.

Although originally designed to send messages to browsers using the `EventSource` DOM element, Server-Sent Events can be generalized for use with non-browser clients as well.

## JSON Patch

[JSON Patch][RFC6902] describes a common format to represent changes in structured data. A JSON Patch response is designated by the `application/json-patch+json` MIME type.

A patch is comprised by an array of operations. Six operation types are defined in the specification: `add`, `remove`, `replace`, `move`, `copy`, and `test`. Each operation specifies its type (`op`), a `path`, and an optional `value` or `from` field:

    [
      { "op": "add", "path": "/a/b/c", "value": [ "foo", "bar" ] },
      { "op": "remove", "path": "/a/b/c" },
      { "op": "replace", "path": "/a/b/c", "value": 42 },
      { "op": "move", "from": "/a/b/c", "path": "/a/b/d" },
      { "op": "copy", "from": "/a/b/d", "path": "/a/b/e" },
      { "op": "test", "path": "/a/b/c", "value": "foo" }
    ]

Although the specification is described primarily in terms of applying a set of changes with an `HTTP` `PATCH` request made by the client to the server, the same structure could represent a change on the server that is communicated to clients as a means of resource synchronization.

# Implementations

### Server

- [Rack::Scaffold](https://github.com/mattt/rack-scaffold) has an [experimental branch](https://github.com/mattt/rack-scaffold/tree/experimental-rocket) that demonstrates how server-sent events can be incorporated systematically into a data provider.

### Client

- [AFRocketClient](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFRocketClient) provides a unified client interface to Rocket, making it easy to build real-time functionality on top of an existing REST app.

# Thinking Out Loud

>> _We've only scratched the surface of what's possible with real-time cloud applications._ What follows are some random thoughts surrounding this space.

- Rocket could also be implemented using web sockets as its transport layer without any other changes.
- It's yet unclear how a traditional MVC architecture should delegate responsibilities for  resource change notifications. Because controllers mediate persistent connections to clients, a strong argument can be made for delegating responsibilities for notification entirely to the controller.
- That said, if JSON Patch were to be re-appropriated as a wire protocol for replication, changes could be streamed directly to clients from the database... which could be awesome.
- A pedantic concern: should the event stream response `Content-Type` somehow encode that the `data` fields are encoded as JSON Patch documents?
- Of the commonly-documented software design patterns, is there one that encapsulates an object providing a concrete implementation for executing patch commands on a collection?
